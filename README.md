# Personal Website With Blog Using Notion as CMS
**Note : I'm not building this from scratch. I just use template from [Bartosz Jarocki](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/jarocki.me).**

My goal is to have a personal website that contains code notes that are easy to access. At first, I wanted to create it using a combination of Astro + Notion, but I haven't found the best way that is easy for me to understand. After interacting a lot with Astro, I didn't expect that I would also use TypeScript, even though I had only used React before. From there, I started to get to know Next.js, which turned out to be easier for me to understand for adding Notion settings as a CMS. Then I found the website [jarocki.me](https://jarocki.me/), which turned out to suit my goals. Without further ado, I decided to temporarily use this template so I could write code notes without worrying about other technicalities.
